# base-converter
simple static html page to convert between numerical bases (2, 10, 16)

## Usage
There are no real dependencies, everything is purely vanilla HTML5, JS, and CSS. Just have all the files in the same directly and open `index.html` in your web browser of choice.

There exists a public hosted version at http://b-illy.github.io/b-illy/base-converter.
